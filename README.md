# Polymer - A flexible cross platform status bar

Polymer is a fast, performant, cross platform status bar.

Nearly all aspects of the status bar can be configured with Lua.

Currently, drawing of the Cairo graphics layer to the screen must be implemented on
each operating system separately, so far this is only implemented for macOS.
